# DesignPatterns

## Creational Design Patterns

###  Singleton

#### Why?

*The most important thing that you have to know before using any design pattern is the cause of using. 
Application needs one, and only one, instance of an object.

### Builder

#### Why?

sometimes you need to define complex objects with a lot of arguments in developing the application, so just imagine what happened in constructor of class with a large number of arguments and how much it is difficult to create an instance or developing new features???


#### How?

builder design pattern allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions. The construction is controlled by a director object that only needs to know the type of object it is to create.
